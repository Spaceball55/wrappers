# Bash Scripts
An easily-accessible directory of the wrappers which I added to my .bashrc for my personal use.

## download.sh
Takes in a .txt file as an input and uses `wget` to download every file. On line 1 of the `input.txt` document, just make sure that it is the first file you want to download

## fileclear.sh
Takes in a path to a directory and clears every file in it. If using relative paths, make sure to access the target directory from its parent directory.
