# wrappers

A small library of wrappers and scripts I've written in BASH, Python and R for use in Dr. Chen's lab at the Baylor College of Medicine

As of July 24, 2023, most of these are related to variant effect prediction ML model preprocessing, testing, building, and analysis, but some of these are for general use in the Linux terminal

Most of these have some documentation if you either check the source code or type `vim {filename}`

If you have any questions or run into any bugs, please email me at David.Rauch@bcm.edu
